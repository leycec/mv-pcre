--------------------( SYNOPSIS                            )--------------------
AsciiDoc-formatted front-facing GitHub documentation.

--------------------( DESCRIPTION                         )--------------------
This file is intentionally in AsciiDoc rather than Markdown or reStructuredText
(reST) format to avoid conflict with the top-level "README.md" file
auto-generated by Minilla. Ergo, there exist two competing "README.*" files:

* "README.adoc", authored manually. GitHub preferentially renders this file as
  the front-facing documentation for this repository, despite the existence of
  a competing "README.md" file. Why? GitHub fortuitously prefers the first
  lexicographically-sorted top-level "README.*" file in a repository, thus
  implicitly preferring "README.adoc" before "README.md".
* "README.md", autogenerated by Minilla from Perl-specific POD embedded in the
  "script/mvre" file. GitHub ignores this file when rendering front-facing
  documentation for this repository, as previously detailed.

Ideally, we would instead configure Minilla to disable autogeneration of
"README.md" files *OR* adopt a competing build system. Unfortunately, Minilla
supports no such configuration; likewise, the only comparable build system is
Dist::Milla, which also supports no such configuration. While adopting
Dist::Zilla would solve this issue, doing so would also introduce a variety of
other issues -- including the non-triviality of both installing and using
Dist::Zilla, which could prove a significant barrier to entry for prospective
contributers and maintainers. In short, authoring front-facing documentation in
AsciiDoc syntax is a least awful available option.
